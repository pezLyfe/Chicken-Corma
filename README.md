Tasty spicy chicken with yogurt topping, perfect for a quick and light lunch

## How to run this:

-download your favorite Python IDE. (I use VSCode)

-get my script from GitHub

-open the script in your IDE and install all required dependancies by typing pip install -r requirements.txt into the IDE's terminal. You can get to the the terminal on VSC by pressing CMD and ` at the same time.

-run the market_scanner.py and it will print out results into the terminal
-you can also graph any ticker's volume in grapher.py

## Controlling the Script
-Line 17 controls the amount of months of historical volume the script gets

-Line 75 controls the amount of days before today that it will alert you

-Line 84 controls the number of standard deviations away from the mean volume
